**xk6-mqtt** `v0.1.1` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is a maintenance release, with one small change, to make metric names consistent.

## Metric names have been made consistent.

The following metric names previously had "message" in the singular, which was inconsistent with other k6 metric names. They have now been fixed:
- `mqtt_messages_sent`
- `mqtt_messages_received`

The following metrics are currently not in demand, but can be created if needed. They have now been removed.
- `mqtt_data_sent`
- `mqtt_data_received`
