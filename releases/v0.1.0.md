**xk6-mqtt** `v0.1.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is the initial release.

**xk6-mqtt** is a k6 extension that adds first-class support for the [MQTT](https://mqtt.org) protocol to your load testing and performance scripts. With this extension, you can connect to MQTT brokers, publish and subscribe to topics, and interact with MQTT systems directly from your k6 tests.

The [xk6-mqtt API](https://mqtt.x.k6.io) is intentionally designed to feel familiar to users of [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js), the popular JavaScript MQTT client. This means you can leverage event-driven programming, both synchronous and asynchronous operations, and migrate existing MQTT.js-based test logic with minimal changes. The extension aims to provide a modern, ergonomic developer experience for MQTT load testing in JavaScript.

**xk6-mqtt** is in an early stage of development but is already usable for many MQTT load testing scenarios.

The basic structure of a MQTT test looks like this:

```javascript
import { Client } from "k6/x/mqtt";

export default function () {
  const client = new Client()

  client.on("connect", () => {
    console.log("Connected to MQTT broker")
    client.subscribe("greeting")
    client.publish("greeting", "Hello MQTT!")
  })

  client.on("message", (topic, message) => {
    const str = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(message))
    console.info("topic:", topic, "message:", str)
    client.end()
  })

  client.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Disconnected from MQTT broker")
  })

  client.connect(__ENV["MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS"] || "mqtt://broker.emqx.io:1883")
}
```
