**MQTT protocol support for k6**

**xk6-mqtt** is a k6 extension that adds first-class support for the [MQTT](https://mqtt.org) protocol to your load testing and performance scripts. With this extension, you can connect to MQTT brokers, publish and subscribe to topics, and interact with MQTT systems directly from your k6 tests.

The [xk6-mqtt API](https://mqtt.x.k6.io) is intentionally designed to feel familiar to users of [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js), the popular JavaScript MQTT client. This means you can leverage event-driven programming, both synchronous and asynchronous operations, and migrate existing MQTT.js-based test logic with minimal changes. The extension aims to provide a modern, ergonomic developer experience for MQTT load testing in JavaScript.

## Example

Comparing HTTP-based tests to MQTT ones, you’ll find differences in both structure and inner workings. The primary difference is that instead of continuously looping the main function (`export default function() { ... }`) over and over, each VU is now runs an asynchronous event loop.

When the MQTT connection is created, the `connect` handler function will be immediately called, all code inside it will be executed (usually code to set up other event handlers), and then blocked until the MQTT connection is closed (by the remote host or by using `client.end()`).

The basic structure of a MQTT test looks like this:

```javascript file=examples/hello.js
import { Client } from "k6/x/mqtt";

export default function () {
  const client = new Client()

  client.on("connect", () => {
    console.log("Connected to MQTT broker")
    client.subscribe("greeting")
    client.publish("greeting", "Hello MQTT!")
  })

  client.on("message", (topic, message) => {
    const str = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(message))
    console.info("topic:", topic, "message:", str)
    client.end()
  })

  client.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Disconnected from MQTT broker")
  })

  client.connect(__ENV["MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS"] || "mqtt://broker.emqx.io:1883")
}
```

You can find more examples in the [examples](./examples/) folder.

## Async Programming

**xk6-mqtt** fully supports async and event-based programming. You can use [setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout), [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval), and other asynchronous patterns together with xk6-mqtt's event handlers such as `on("connect")`, `on("message")`, and `on("end")`. This allows you to implement complex MQTT workflows, timers, and message handling logic in a style familiar to JavaScript developers.

```javascript file=examples/ping.js
import { Client } from "k6/x/mqtt";

export default function () {
  const client = new Client()

  client.on("connect", async () => {
    console.log("Connected to MQTT broker")
    await client.subscribeAsync("probe")

    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      client.publish("probe", "ping MQTT!")
    }, 1000)

    setTimeout(() => {
      clearInterval(intervalId)
      client.end()
    }, 3100)
  })

  client.on("message", (topic, message) => {
    console.info(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, new Uint8Array(message)))
  })

  client.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Disconnected from MQTT broker")
  })

  client.connect(__ENV["MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS"] || "mqtt://broker.emqx.io:1883")
}
```

## Event-Driven Usage
 
Register event handlers for connection lifecycle and message events using `.on()` method:
 
 | Event        | Description
 |--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
 | `connect`  | Triggered when the client successfully connects to the broker.
 | `message`  | Triggered when a message is received on a subscribed topic.
 | `end`      | Triggered when the client disconnects from the broker.
 | `reconnect`| Triggered when the client attempts to reconnect.
 | `error`    | Triggered when an error occurs.

All event handlers are executed in the context of the k6 VU event loop.

## SSL/TLS

**xk6-mqtt** does not provide its own custom TLS configuration options. Instead, it relies on the standard [k6 TLS configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/protocols/ssl-tls/) for all SSL/TLS settings. This means you should configure certificates, verification, and other TLS-related options using the same environment variables and configuration files as you would for any other k6 protocol. This approach ensures consistency across your k6 tests and leverages the robust, well-documented TLS support already present in k6.

## Supported Broker URL Schemas

**xk6-mqtt** supports connecting to MQTT brokers using the following URL schemas:

| Schema      | Description
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------
| `mqtt://`   | Plain TCP connection (no encryption)
| `mqtts://`  | Secure connection over SSL/TLS (recommended for production)
| `tcp://`    | Alias for `mqtt://`, plain TCP connection
| `ssl://`    | Alias for `mqtts://`, secure SSL/TLS connection
| `tls://`    | Alias for `mqtts://`, secure SSL/TLS connection
| `ws://`     | MQTT over WebSocket (if supported by the broker)
| `wss://`    | MQTT over secure WebSocket (if supported by the broker)

Specify the broker URL using one of these schemas when calling `client.connect()`.  
For example:

```javascript
client.connect("mqtt://broker.example.com:1883")
client.connect("mqtts://broker.example.com:8883")
client.connect("ws://broker.example.com:8083/mqtt")
client.connect("wss://broker.example.com:8084/mqtt")
```

If you omit the schema in the broker URL, `mqtt://` (plain TCP) is used as the default.

## Quick Start

1. **Build a custom k6 binary with xk6-mqtt**  
   You need to build k6 with this extension using [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6):

   ```sh
   go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
   xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-mqtt
   ```

2. **Write your test script**  
   Use the example above or create your own test script using the `Client` API.

3. **Run your test**  
   Use your custom k6 binary to run the script:

   ```sh
   ./k6 run script.js
   ```

## Download

Pre-built binaries for k6 with the xk6-mqtt extension are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-mqtt/releases/).

## Limitations

- The underlying [Eclipse Paho](https://eclipse.dev/paho/) MQTT library supports version v3.1.1 of the MQTT protocol. MQTT v5 is not supported yet.

We welcome contributions! Please see the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started.

## Status

**xk6-mqtt** is in an early stage of development but is already usable for many MQTT load testing scenarios. We are actively working to improve the extension. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
